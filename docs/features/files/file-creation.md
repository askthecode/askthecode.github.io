# File Creation

## Overview

The File Creation feature in AskTheCode enables users to add new files to a GitHub repository directly through the plugin interface. This functionality simplifies the process of contributing new content to a project, allowing for quick and seamless integration of new resources, documentation, or code.

## Why It's Useful

- **Simplifies Adding New Files**: Directly create files in a repository without needing to navigate GitHub's UI.
- **Supports Various File Types**: Whether you're adding code, documentation, or other resources, the file creation feature supports it.
- **Streamlines Project Contributions**: Makes it easier for contributors to add new content, enhancing project collaboration.

## How to Use

1. **Select the Repository and Branch**: Start by specifying the GitHub repository URL where you want to create the file. If necessary, also specify the branch.
2. **Provide File Details**: Indicate the path where the file should be created and its name. Include the directory structure if the file should be nested within specific folders.
3. **Enter File Content**: Write or paste the content you wish to include in the new file. This can be code, text, or any other content suitable for your project.
4. **Commit the New File**: Finalize the creation by committing the file to the repository. You can include a commit message to describe the addition.

## Example

```prompt
I want to add a new file named "example.txt" with the content "Hello, world!" to the main branch of https://github.com/username/repository. Here's the content:
```
```
Hello, world!
```
