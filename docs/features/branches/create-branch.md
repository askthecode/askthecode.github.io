# Create Branch

#### Overview

The **Create Branch** feature allows users to create a new branch within a GitHub repository directly from the AskTheCode interface. This feature streamlines the process of branching, enabling users to easily manage different development paths or features within the project.

#### Why It's Useful

- **Streamlines Branch Creation**: Simplifies the process of creating a new branch, making it accessible directly from the chat interface.
- **Supports Multiple Development Paths**: Facilitates the management of different features or development directions by allowing easy branch creation.
- **Facilitates Safe File Management**: Aligns well with the file content management features, highly recommended to let AskTheCode manage files in a new branch to prevent corrupting working code.

#### How to Use

1. **Provide the Repository URL**: Begin by providing the GitHub repository URL to the AskTheCode plugin.
2. **Specify the New Branch Name**: Indicate the desired name for the new branch. It's important to follow any naming conventions your project adheres to.
3. **Identify the Source Branch (Optional)**: If you want the new branch to be created from a specific branch other than the default, specify the source branch.

#### Sample

```prompt
Please create a new branch named "feature-x" in https://github.com/username/repository from the "development" branch.
```

#### Conclusion

The **Create Branch** feature is primarily designed to enhance the file editing experience by providing a safe environment for managing changes. Creating a new branch is highly recommended when working on modifications, ensuring that the main project's code remains intact and operational. This approach not only supports strategic project organization but also emphasizes the importance of using AskTheCode for efficient and safe file content management within projects.
