# Create Branch

#### Overview

The **Create Branch** feature allows users to create a new branch within a GitHub repository directly from the AskTheCode interface. This feature streamlines the process of branching, enabling users to easily manage different development paths or features within the project.

#### Why It's Useful

- **Streamlines Branch Creation**: Simplifies the process of creating a new branch, making it accessible directly from the chat interface.
- **Supports Multiple Development Paths**: Facilitates the management of different features or development directions by allowing easy branch creation.
- **Facilitates Safe File Management**: Aligns well with the file content management features, highly recommended to let AskTheCode manage files in a new branch to prevent corrupting working code.

#### How to Use

1. **Provide the Repository URL**: Begin by providing the GitHub repository URL to the AskTheCode plugin.
2. **Specify the New Branch Name**: Indicate the desired name for the new branch. It's important to follow any naming conventions your project adheres to.
3. **Identify the Source Branch (Optional)**: If you want the new branch to be created from a specific branch other than the default, specify the source branch.

#### Sample

```prompt
Please create a new branch named "feature-x" in https://github.com/username/repository from the "development" branch.
```

#### Conclusion

The **Create Branch** feature is an essential tool for efficient GitHub repository management, offering a simple and direct method to expand the project's structure with new branches. It supports strategic project organization and facilitates the development of new features or paths within the project.
