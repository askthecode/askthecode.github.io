# List Branches

The "List Branches" feature enables users to view all branches within a specific GitHub repository directly from the AskTheCode interface. This functionality provides an overview of the repository's branch structure, making it easier to navigate and manage different versions of the project.

## Usage

To list all branches in a repository:

1. Navigate to the repository within the AskTheCode plugin.
2. Select the "List Branches" option from the menu.
3. The plugin will display a list of all branches in the repository, including the default branch.

This feature is particularly useful for developers looking to switch contexts between different branches or to get a quick overview of the repository's branches.
