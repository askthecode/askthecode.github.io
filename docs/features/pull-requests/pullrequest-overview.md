# Pull Request Overview

### Overview

The `Pull Request Overview` feature provides a detailed view of the individual pull request in a GitHub repository. This allows users to see comprehensive information about each pull request, including status, contributors, and linked issues.

### Why It's Useful

- **Detailed Information**: Offers a detailed view of pull requests, including the conversation, file changes, essential metrics such as additions, deletions etc.
- **Collaboration Facilitation**: Aids in reviewing contributions, making collaborative decisions easier.
- **Simplifies Small PRs**: Works best for small PRs, that can be processed in one go. For PRs with large conversations or with lots of changes see [Pull Requests Comments](/features/pull-requests/pullrequest-comments.md) and [Pull Requests Changes](/features/pull-requests/pullrequest-changes.md) features.

### How to Use

1. **Provide the Pull Request URL**: Start by providing the GitHub pull request URL to the AskTheCode GPT.
2. **Request Pull Request Details**: Request pull request overview or the specific details you are interested in.

### Sample

```prompt
https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/pull/2048
Please give me an overview of the pull request, describe each change and summarize the conversation
```

### Conclusion

**Pull Request Overview** feature sufficiently simplifies interaction with GitHub pull requests. It helps to grasp the idea of the pull request details and introduced changes.
